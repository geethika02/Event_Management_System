# Event Management System

There is always chaos in remembering exam dates, submission deadlines, etc. Other than this a proof of an event on a certain date for attendance is always scattered and due to the loss of proof the genuine attendance is also lost.

To solve this issue we built a solution that can facilitate the addition of events, exams, submissions, holidays, etc to the calendar such that there is a simple understanding of everything date-wise with reminders too.

In this project you can set remainders and update them using the google calender api.

You have to download your own secret file of google calender api and insert in the code as well as user id too.
